# Presentations

> All my talks and presentations

> **Disclaimer**
> This is a work in progress, my previous talks can be seen at [my slides website on speakerdeck](https://slides.lsantos.dev) but I'll gradually migrate everything here, probably not backfilling everything as a Slidev presentation because it would be a huge work, but all my new talks will be created as code and exported as standalone pages to be seen directly on the web.

# I want to use your slides

You can use my slides as a base for your own presentations, but *please give me the proper credits*. I'm not a fan of people copying my content and presenting it as their own, but I'm a big fan of people using my content as a base for their own presentations. If you do so, please let me know, I'd love to see what you created.

If you want to use the slides per se, you can access them from the links below, feel free to present them at your own company or event, but **refrain from altering** them and presenting them as your own, **always** give the proper credits. If you want to alter them, please reach out to me. I'm always open to collaboration.

# About me

I'm a software engineer for over a decade. I'm originally from Brazil, but live in Sweden since 2021. I'm a TypeScript enthusiast and I love to talk about it. I'm also a big fan of open source and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

I love to create content and was recognized by it in the past, being awarded as a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2018. I'm also a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies since 2019 and Docker Capitain since 2019. Most of my content is in Portuguese, and you can find me on:

I have a **TypeScript course** called [Formação TypeScript](https://formacaots.com.br) which is in Portuguese and it's a complete course for beginners and advanced developers. It's a paid course, but I also have a lot of free content about TypeScript on my blog and YouTube channel.

I [wrote a book on Kubernetes](https://tudosobrekubernetes.tech) in 2018, also in Portuguese. It's a complete book for beginners and advanced developers, and it's also a paid book, but I also have a lot of free content about Kubernetes on my blog and YouTube channel.
