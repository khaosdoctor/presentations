# Presentations

> All my talks and presentations

> **Disclaimer**
> This is a work in progress, my previous talks can be seen at [my slides website on speakerdeck](https://slides.lsantos.dev) but I'll gradually migrate everything here, probably not backfilling everything as a Slidev presentation because it would be a huge work, but all my new talks will be created as code and exported as standalone pages to be seen directly on the web.

# Talks

- [Kneel Before Zod: Unlocking the secrets for an error-proof TypeScript application](https://oss.lsantos.dev/presentations/static/kneel-before-zod)

# About me

I'm a software engineer for over a decade. I'm originally from Brazil, but live in Sweden since 2021. I'm a TypeScript enthusiast and I love to talk about it. I'm also a big fan of open source and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.

I love to create content and was recognized by it in the past, being awarded as a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2018. I'm also a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies since 2019 and Docker Capitain since 2019. Most of my content is in Portuguese, and you can find me on:

I have a **TypeScript course** called [Formação TypeScript](https://formacaots.com.br) which is in Portuguese and it's a complete course for beginners and advanced developers. It's a paid course, but I also have a lot of free content about TypeScript on my blog and YouTube channel.

I [wrote a book on Kubernetes](https://tudosobrekubernetes.tech) in 2018, also in Portuguese. It's a complete book for beginners and advanced developers, and it's also a paid book, but I also have a lot of free content about Kubernetes on my blog and YouTube channel.
