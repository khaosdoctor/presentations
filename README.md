# Presentations

> All my talks and presentations

# Disclaimer

This is a work in progress, my previous talks can be seen at [my slides website on speakerdeck](https://slides.lsantos.dev) but I'll gradually migrate everything here, probably not backfilling everything as a Slidev presentation because it would be a huge work, but all my new talks will be created as code and exported as standalone pages to be seen directly on the web.
